<p><h2>Anglerfish fun fact</h2><br> King cobras are found in various shades of red, yellow, black, and orange depending on the area in which it lives. They have designs on their scales that can vary as well, displaying as mottled colors, bands, and various other patterns.<br>They have hollow fangs at the front of the mouth that are fixed to the upper jaw. Because they don’t have the jaw strength to hold their prey down with their fangs, they will inject venom instead. They have an infamous neck-flap and ‘hiss’ as a threat display and mainly prey on other snakes, including their own species.<br>Each Bite Has Enough Venom to Kill an Elephant in 3hrs
A very small amount of a king cobra’s neurotoxic venom is released when it bites.This tiny amount has the power to paralyze its prey and can even kill a human within minutes after being bitten.It is so deadly, in fact, a huge animal, like an elephant, can pass away within a few hours of sustaining a bite.</p>
